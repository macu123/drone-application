## How to move Drone using Engines
- High engine power means faster speed, and low engine power means slower speed.
- To move forward along Y axis, engine 0 and 1 should have low power while engine 2 and 3 should have high power.
- To move backward along Y axis, engine 2 and 3 should have low power while engine 0 and 1 should have high power.
- To move leftward along X axis, engine 0 and 2 should have low power while engine 1 and 3 should have high power.
- To move rightward along X axis, engine 1 and 3 should have low power while engine 0 and 2 should have high power.
- To move upward along Z axis, all engines should have high power.
- To move downward along Z axis, all engines should have low power.
- To stabilize, all engines should have certain power because the drone has weight.
